I’m Nooshin — an experienced data scientist diving into the world of Generative AI and sharing the journey along the way.
This is my corner where I share my hands-on learning journey through bite-sized tutorials, helpful resources, and experiments in GenAI, machine learning, and data science. 
Along the way, I’ll also share practical insights I’ve gained from real-world analytical projects as well.
It’s all about learning by doing and hopefully making things a bit easier for anyone else on the same path. Glad you’re here — let’s learn and build together!
